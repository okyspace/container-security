# Container Security
The objective of this repo is to capture knowledge learnt and level up the understanding of building and running a container with quality and cyber considerations. In general the repo covers:
- Cyber concerns of running a rootful container.
- Type of security scans and tools available. 
- How to build a rootless container.
- How to convert a rootful container to rootless.
- When to use docker vs podman.

## Cyber concerns on running rootful container.
1. root user in container can have excess rights to access host, which can execute any malware, change configurations/settings.
2. TO add on.
     
## Type of security scans and tools available
In this table, tools for quality checks are also included.

| Quality           | SCA                          | Prisma Cloud                 |                             |
| Security          | SAST (whitebox)              | Parasoft, Fortify            | CodeQL (For Github)         |

- SCA is usually more concern for vendor selling products, to avoid licensing issue
- Scantist is similar to Prisma Cloud. It can bring down application upon detection of malware, etc.

## How to build a rootless container

# Example of Dockerfile to build rootless container image

FROM redhat/ubi8:xxx
# install whatever needed as yum install cannot be executed without root user.
RUN yum install xxxx
COPY . .

# set user; set USER towards the end of the dockerfile, so process like apt install can still proceed with default root user first.
# use gid 0, see the recommendation from redhat support and the security risk assessment. 
USER 1000:0

# grant necessary rights to folder to USER
RUN chown 1000:0 /data
 
```

## Checking built container for security issue
- Usually the image can be built with uid 1000, gid 0.
- uid 1000 is not a root user, so make sure the folder that the processes to be run in the container has the necessary r/w/x rights as the owner.
- gid 0 might have some security concern.  Run the following command to check what extra file gid 0 can access. Assess if the files are of security concern. 
```
# inside the container
find / -mount -type f -user root -group root \( -perm -g=r -o -perm -g=w \) -not \( -perm -o=r -o -perm -o=x \) -ls
```

## When to use docker vs podman
- In general, there are some cases where you do not have control over the container and you may need to run with port < 1024, e.g vendor product. You may want to run it with docker instead of podman, since there is no good way to run podman with root.
- Although you can set sudo sysctl net.ipv4_xxxxx_port_start=0 to allow running of ports < 1024 with non-root, but this is pending assessment if there will be cyber concerns.

## Selinux
1. Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for LinuxÂ® systems that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system.
2. Selinux setting is found in /etc/sysconfig/selinux or /etc/selinux/config.
3. Default setting is "enforcing" and "targetting".

### Example
```
# files created at /home
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0    14 May  4 01:06 test1.html
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0    14 May  4 01:07 test2.html
```

```
# cp file change type context but not move.. 
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 29 May  3 22:01 index.html
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 14 May  4 01:07 test1.html
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0        14 May  4 01:07 test2.html
```

## Proper use of Linux Folders
| folder     |                                                             |
| -          | -                                                           |
| /etc       | configurations and settings for the system (e.g. .conf)     |
| /usr       | is used for "user programs". Usually your package manager installs all the binaries, shared files etc. from all programs here (except config files, which go to /etc). You can check /usr/bin for binaries, /usr/share for shared files (media, etc), /usr/share/doc for documentation,...     |
| /opt       | there are "other" programs usually put (mostly binary programs, or programs installed from other sources (not the default package manager). Some programs like that (usually compiled) also go to "/usr/local"    |
| /var       | is usually used for log files, 'temporary' files (like mail spool, printer spool, etc), databases, and all other data not tied to a specific user. Logs are usually in "/var/log", databases in "/var/lib" (mysql - "/var/lib/mysql"), etc.    |


## Why using GID 0 for container running in openshift is OK?
1. Openshift "restricted-v2" scc limits the running of pod within a defined uid range.
2. Nodes are on RHCOREOS, which is immutable, only allow few settings to be changed.
3. Even with GID 0, only /etc/libaudit.conf is accessible, which is assessed to be low risk.
4. Even if GID 0 can escape from ther container to host, the host selinux will limit the access to most files.

Question to find out:
1. How can GID 0 escape from the container to host?
2. Will GID 0 able to change selinux, file permission on RHCOREOS?
3. Does chown folder permission to defined USER helps in accessibility? Or it is strictly accessible due to GID 0? Should be.
4. Is it really safee? Container can be built with malware and brought into OCP and triggered by GID 0? Containers should be scanned by SEP / Prisma Cloud to detect malware as another layer of defence.
5. Will malware be able to propagate from one node to another?
6. Can we run executable in RHCOREOS?



## Security Context for pod / container
```
# security context to run pod with restricted-v2 scc
  containerSecurityContext:
    runAsUser: *uid (openshift project uid)
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsGroup: 0 (Usually this is not set, so default is 0)
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
    capabilities:
      drop: ["ALL"]
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault

```
